description: Learn how to hydrate and dehydrate permissions in your application

## Overview

Hydration is the process of converting server-side state into client-side state. In Permix, hydration allows you to serialize permissions on the server and restore them on the client without running setup logic again.

## Usage

Permix provides two methods for handling hydration:

- `dehydrate` - Converts the current permissions state into a JSON-serializable format
- `hydrate` - Restores permissions from a previously dehydrated state

```ts
import { dehydrate, hydrate } from 'permix'

const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'create' | 'read'
  }
}>()

// Set up initial permissions
permix.setup({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: post => post.isPublic
  }
})

// Dehydrate permissions to JSON
const state = dehydrate(permix)
// Result: { post: { create: true, read: false } }

// Later, hydrate permissions from the state
hydrate(permix, state)
```

<Callout>
Note that function-based permissions will be converted to `false` during dehydration since functions cannot be serialized to JSON. That's why you should call `setup` method on the client side immediately after hydration.
</Callout>

## Server-Side Rendering

Hydration is particularly useful in server-side rendering scenarios where you want to transfer permissions from the server to the client:

```ts
// Express server
import express from 'express'
import { createPermix, dehydrate } from 'permix'

const app = express()
const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'create' | 'read'
  }
}>()

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  // Setup permissions on the server
  permix.setup({
    post: {
      create: true,
      read: true
    }
  })

  // Dehydrate permissions for client
  const dehydratedState = dehydrate(permix)

  // Send HTML with embedded permissions data
  res.send(`
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <script>
          window.__INITIAL_PERMISSIONS__ = ${JSON.stringify(dehydratedState)};
        </script>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div id="app"></div>
        <script type="module">
          // Client-side code
          import { createPermix, hydrate } from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/permix/+esm'

          const permix = createPermix();

          // Hydrate permissions from server data
          hydrate(permix, window.__INITIAL_PERMISSIONS__);

          // Your app code here...
        </script>
      </body>
    </html>
  `)
})
```
