## Overview

Sometimes you need to know when permissions are ready to use. For example, you might want to wait for permissions to be ready before rendering a component. That's where the `isReady()` and `isReadyAsync()` methods come in.

<Callout type="warn">
Note that `isReady()` and `isReadyAsync()` will always return `false` during server-side rendering. It only becomes `true` after the first successful call to `setup()` on the client.
</Callout>


## Usage

### Basic

Permix provides an `isReady()` method to check if permissions have been properly initialized on the client side:

```ts twoslash
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

const permix = createPermix()

console.log(permix.isReady()) // false

// After setup completes
permix.setup({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: true
  }
})

console.log(permix.isReady()) // true
```

### Async

If you need to wait for permissions to be ready in an async context, you can use the `isReadyAsync()` method. This returns a promise that resolves when permissions are ready:

```ts
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

const permix = createPermix()

async function init() {
  await permix.isReadyAsync()
  // Permissions are now ready to use
  const canCreate = permix.check('post', 'create')
}
```

### SSR

This is particularly useful in SSR applications when using function-based permissions, since the dehydration process converts all function permissions to `false` until they are properly rehydrated on the client.

</Callout>

```ts
import { dehydrate, hydrate, createPermix } from 'permix'
import { permix } from './permix'

permix.setup({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: post => post.isPublic
  }
})

// Dehydrate permissions on the server
const state = dehydrate(permix)
// { post: { create: true, read: false } }

// Rehydrate permissions on the client
hydrate(permix, state)

const canRead = permix.check('post', 'read', { isPublic: true }) // false

permix.hook('ready', (state) => {
  const canRead = permix.check('post', 'read', { isPublic: true })
  console.log(canRead) // true
})
```
