## Overview

After creating Permix instance, you need to define permissions with `setup` method. You can call `setup` in any time with any permissions and Permix will replace the previous permissions.

<Callout type="warn">
You always should describe all permissions in the `setup` method that was defined in the Permix generic type.
</Callout>

<Callout>
For role separation, you can use the [`template`](/docs/guide/template) method.
</Callout>

### Object definition

```ts
const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'create'
  }
  comment: {
    action: 'create' | 'update'
  }
}>()

await permix.setup({
  post: {
    create: true,
  },
  comment: {
    create: true,
    update: true,
  }
})
```

<Callout>
You can also use `enum` based permissions. See [Enum-based](/docs/examples/enum-based) for more information.
</Callout>

### Callback definition

The `setup` method is an async function that requires awaiting due to event handlers. For cases where direct awaiting isn't possible, you can pass a callback function to `setup` to handle async operations internally.

```ts
permix.setup(async () => {
  // Fetch user, role, etc.
  const user = await fetchUser()

  return {
    post: {
      create: true,
    },
    comment: {
      create: true,
      update: comment => comment.authorId === user.id
    }
  }
})
```

## Type-Based

When creating a Permix instance, you can define entities that will be used in the `setup` method for each related entity. This allows you to check permissions for specific data entities. So instead of `boolean` you can use functions to check permissions.

```ts twoslash
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

interface Post {
  id: string
  authorId: string
}

const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    dataType: Post
//  ^^^^^^^^
    action: 'update'
  }
  comment: {
    action: 'update'
  }
}>()

// @noErrors
await permix.setup({
  post: {
    update: post => post.
//                       ^|
  }
  comment: {
    update: comment => c
//          ^?
  }
})
```

### unknown

If you cannot define entity types in the Permix instance, the types will be `unknown` by default, but you can still define them later in the `setup` method.

This approach is not recommended as it reduces type safety and IDE support.

```ts twoslash
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

const permix = createPermix<{
  comment: {
    action: 'update'
  }
}>()

// @noErrors
await permix.setup({
  comment: {
    update: (comment: { authorId: string }) => comment.authorId === user.id
  }
})
```
