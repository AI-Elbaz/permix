## Overview

Permix provides an event system that allows you to react to permission changes in your application. Currently, there is one event available: `setup`, which is triggered whenever permissions are updated through the `setup` method.

<Callout>
Events are powered by the [`hookable`](https://github.com/unjs/hookable) package, a lightweight and type-safe event system.

## Usage

You can register event handlers using the `hook` method:

```ts
const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'create' | 'read'
  }
}>()

permix.hook('setup', () => {
  console.log('Permissions were updated')
})

// The handler will be called when setup is executed
await permix.setup({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: true
  }
})
```

Available events:

- `setup` - Triggered when permissions are updated through the `setup` method.
- `ready` - Triggered when the permissions are ready to be used.
