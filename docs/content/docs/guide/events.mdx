## Overview

Permix provides an event system that allows you to react to permission changes in your application. Each event provides type-safe data and hooks to register handlers.

## Usage

You can register event handlers using the `hook` and `hookOnce` methods:

```ts
const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'create' | 'read'
  }
}>()

// The handler will be called every time setup is executed
permix.hook('setup', () => {
  console.log('Permissions were updated')
})

// The handler will be called only once
permix.hookOnce('setup', () => {
  console.log('Permissions were updated once')
})

// Calling `setup` method triggers the `setup` event
// and `ready` event if called on the client side
permix.setup({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: true
  }
})
```

Available events:

- `setup` - Triggered when permissions are updated through the `setup` method.
- `ready` - Triggered when the permissions are ready to be used.
- `hydrate` - Triggered when the permissions are hydrated from the server.
