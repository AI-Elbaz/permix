## Installation

<Steps>

<Step>

### Install Permix

Typically you'll need to install Permix using your package manager:

```package-install
permix
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Create an instance

To create a base instance, you need to provide a schema as a generic type to `createPermix` function that defines your permissions:

```ts title="/lib/permix.ts"
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

export const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete'
  }
}>()

// ...
```

Learn more about features and configuration of instances in the [instance guide](/docs/guide/instance).

</Step>

<Step>

### Setup your permissions

You can setup your permissions by calling `setup` method on your instance in any place you want:

```ts title="/lib/permix.ts"
// ...

// Call setupPermissions in your application
export function setupPermissions() {
  permix.setup({
    post: {
      create: true,
      read: true,
      update: true,
      delete: false,
    },
  })
}
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Check permissions

After setup, you can use `check` method to check available permissions:

```ts
permix.check('post', 'create') // true
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Finish

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

You've now got a basic setup of Permix. The next step is to learn more about 3 core concepts of Permix:

- [Instance](/docs/guide/instance)
- [Setup](/docs/guide/setup)
- [Check](/docs/guide/check)
- Of course, do not hesitate to read other guide pages.
