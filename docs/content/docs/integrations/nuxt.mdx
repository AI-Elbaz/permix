## Overview

Permix seamlessly integrates with Nuxt applications, providing full support for both server and client components through the [Vue integration](/docs/integrations/vue).

<Callout>
Before getting started with Nuxt integration, make sure you've completed the initial setup steps in the [Quick Start](/docs/quick-start) guide.

<Steps>

<Step>

## Setup

First, create a Nuxt plugin to set up Permix:

```ts title="plugins/permix.ts"
import { permixPlugin } from 'permix/nuxt'
import { permix } from '../utils/permix'

export default defineNuxtPlugin(permixPlugin(permix))
```

The plugin will:
- Register the Vue plugin
- Handle server-side state hydration
- Automatically synchronize permissions between server and client

<Callout>
Make sure to create and export your Permix instance from a separate file (e.g., `utils/permix.ts`).
