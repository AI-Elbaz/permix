## Idea

In my many years of experience, I have worked extensively with permissions management, and early in my career I wrote solutions that looked like this:

```ts
if (user.role === 'admin') {
  // do something
}
```

Later, I started using [CASL](https://casl.js.org) for permissions management in a [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) application.

```ts
can('read', ['Post', 'Comment']);
can('manage', 'Post', { author: 'me' });
can('create', 'Comment');
```

But time goes on, CASL becomes older, and developers' needs grow, especially for type-safe libraries. Unfortunately, CASL couldn't satisfy my type validation needs and so I started thinking again about writing my own validation solution. But this time I wanted to make it as a library, as I already had experience with open-source.

## Implementation

A couple of weeks later, I started to create my own solution. However, nothing occurred to me until I watched a Web Dev Simplified [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GG-VUvruzE) where he demonstrated an example of implementing permission management as he envisioned it. I really liked his approach because it was based on type-safety, which is exactly what I needed.

So I'm ready to present to you my permission management solution called Permix!

## DX

When creating Permix, the goal was to simplify DX as much as possible without losing type-safety and provide the necessary functionality.

That is why you only need to write the following code to get started:

```ts twoslash
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'read'
  }
}>()

permix.setup({
  post: {
    read: true,
  }
})

const canReadPost = permix.check('post', 'read') // true
```

It looks too simple, so here's a more interesting example:

```ts twoslash
import type { PermixDefinition } from 'permix'
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

// You can take types from your database
interface User {
  id: string
  role: 'editor' | 'user'
}

interface Post {
  id: string
  title: string
  authorId: string
  published: boolean
}

interface Comment {
  id: string
  content: string
  authorId: string
}

// Create Permix to describe your permissions
type PermissionsDefinition = PermixDefinition<{
  post: {
    dataType: Post
    action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete'
  }
  comment: {
    dataType: Comment
    action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update'
  }
}>

const permix = createPermix<PermissionsDefinition>()

// Define permissions for different users
const editorPermissions = permix.template({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: true,
    update: post => !post.published,
    delete: post => !post.published,
  },
  comment: {
    create: false,
    read: true,
    update: false,
  },
})

const userPermissions = permix.template(({ id: userId }: User) => ({
  post: {
    create: false,
    read: true,
    update: false,
    delete: false,
  },
  comment: {
    create: true,
    read: true,
    update: comment => comment.authorId === userId,
  },
}))

async function getUser() {
  // Imagine that this function is fetching user from database
  return {
    id: '1',
    role: 'editor' as const,
  }
}

// Setup permissions for signed in user
async function setupPermix() {
  const user = await getUser()
  const permissionsMap = {
    editor: () => editorPermissions(),
    user: () => userPermissions(user),
  }

  permix.setup(permissionsMap[user.role]())
}

// Call setupPermix where you need to setup permissions
setupPermix()

// Check if a user has permission to do something
const canCreatePost = permix.check('post', 'create')

async function getComment() {
  // Imagine that this function is fetching comment from database
  return {
    id: '1',
    content: 'Hello, world!',
    authorId: '1',
  }
}

const comment = await getComment()

const canUpdateComment = permix.check('comment', 'update', comment)
```

## Benefits

What are the benefits of using Permix?

- 100% type-safe without writing TypeScript (except for initialization)
- Single source of truth for your entire app
- Perfect match for TypeScript monorepos
- Zero dependencies
- Useful methods for specific cases
- Large number of integrations for different frameworks, such as [React](/docs/integrations/react), [Vue](/docs/integrations/vue), [Next.js](/docs/integrations/next), and more.
