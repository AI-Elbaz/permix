## Idea

The idea to create a new permissions library came after watching Web Dev Simplified's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GG-VUvruzE) about permissions management and another attempt to combine [CASL](https://casl.js.org/) for both client and server without losing type-safety. This experience inspired the creation of Permix, which allows developers to implement permissions for frontend and backend applications written in TypeScript using a single source of truth across the entire app.

## DX

When creating Permix, the goal was to simplify DX as much as possible without losing type-safety and provide the necessary functionality.

That is why you only need to write the following code to get started:

```ts
import { createPermix } from 'permix'

const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    action: 'read'
  }
}>()

permix.setup({
  post: {
    read: true,
  }
})

permix.check('post', 'read') // true
```

It looks too simple, so here's a more interesting example:

```ts
// You can take types from your database
interface User {
  id: string
  role: 'editor' | 'user'
}

interface Post {
  id: string
  title: string
  authorId: string
  published: boolean
}

interface Comment {
  id: string
  content: string
  authorId: string
}

// Create Permix to describe your permissions
const permix = createPermix<{
  post: {
    dataType: Post
    action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete'
  }
  comment: {
    dataType: Comment
    action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update'
  }
}>()

// Define permissions for different users
const editorPermissions = permix.template({
  post: {
    create: true,
    read: true,
    update: post => !post.published,
    delete: post => !post.published,
  },
  comment: {
    create: false,
    read: true,
    update: false,
  },
})

const userPermissions = permix.template(({ id: userId }: User) => ({
  post: {
    create: false,
    read: true,
    update: false,
    delete: false,
  },
  comment: {
    create: true,
    read: true,
    update: comment => comment.authorId === userId,
  },
}))

// Setup permissions for signed in user
async function setupPermix() {
  const user = await getUser()
  const permissionsMap = {
    editor: () => editorPermissions(),
    user: () => userPermissions(user),
  }

  permix.setup(permissionsMap[user.role]())
}

// Call setupPermix where you need to setup permissions
setupPermix()

// Check if a user has permission to do something
permix.check('post', 'create')

const comment = await getComment()

permix.check('comment', 'update', comment)
```

## Benefits

What are the benefits of using Permix?

- 100% type-safe without writing TypeScript (except for init)
- Single source of truth for entire app
- Perfect match for TypeScript monorepos
- 0 dependencies
- Useful methods for specific cases
- Large number of integrations for different frameworks, such as [React](/docs/integrations/react), [Vue](/docs/integrations/vue), [Next.js](/docs/integrations/next) etc.
